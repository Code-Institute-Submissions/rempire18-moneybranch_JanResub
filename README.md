* I thought about this project as there were times that I don't have any income.
* Because of my restrictions, I just find a way to hustle everyday for money.
* So here comes the internet to the rescue. It pointed me to sites where I can earn a hotmeal after using a mouse or tapping a mobile screen.
* As there are many websites out there that do this, some can be hard to deal with (meaning always screened out, takes too long to make a cash out), so I decided to make a list of those sites I personally tried and tested.

# User Goals
* Users want to explore ways of monetizing their clicks and taps on their devices.
* Users want to help the internet community to improve user experiences by testing sites and getting paid for it.
* Users want to have something that can make them get by when money is hard to come by.
* note: this is not a get rich scheme or an alternative to employment.

# Developer Goals
* It aims to identify websites that are legitimate in this business.
* In the future, we will build functionalities like ratings review to sites we test and comments section for user experiences, tips and tricks of the trade.
* Will create searchrankings according to these ratings.

# Website Owner Goals
* We will personally test more websites offering this kind of service on money you can earn versus the time you spend.
* We will advice users if they are just wasting their time or it is time to move on to another services.
* We will conduct testing on sites shared by our users.

# A User's Story

* A sanction affected my work and I need to abandon my job. I need to  start somewhere in a new world that I am not familiar with. With no friends to turn to and family's very far away, I decided to look for something in the virtual world.

* At first, it is a challenge and like in the real world, there are plenty of sites that just waste your time and want to get your money. Luckily I do not have what they wanted (money) and left me alone. 

* I came across website testing, mystery shopping and academic research, all online. Now I can afford a KFC meal. I know it is not much, but for me with my feet and hands tied to afford this, is something.

# Design Choices

* This site is geared to those people looking for a legitimate way to get some extra cash from their browsing habit. 

* Links to legitimate, tested and real money making sites without cash outlay are in this site. 

* So simple design is in mind. An introduction to what MoneyTree is all about, it's aim, what it can do to the user and simple links that transport the user to the legitimate sites.

* A signup page for news letters that is set for at least every forthnight is also provided.

* In the future, a tips and tricks section will be included for users to help other users in identifying legitimate sites and rank them accordingly.


## Colors

I was thorn between the colors of money and leaf as the main theme, but because these colours are very similar, I used them both throughout the project. I also used all the primary colors plus the neutral white and near-black to show the diversity of what money can do in the world.

## Typography

I used Oswald family, sans-serif font to make the design simpler and more money looking.

## Images

I used screenshots I made my own and the main image from pexels. The icons were grabbed from fonawesome and pixabay.

## Design Elements

This is my first time to make a website from scratch. I do not know what works and I do not know what components to fit in. So I based most of the design from the project Love Running, like the top menu, footer, buttons and texts inputs.

I also used mainly google to point me on how to make boxes, cards, bootstraps etc. I am pointed usually to the direction of W3C to get shippets of the codes as the instructions to do this in the videos took me hours of sifting thorough the instructions I need. 

*So every code I used here are from the code institute, W3school, pixabay and bootstrap. I just edited them and pernonalised them to suite the site.

In the future, I would like to make everything with dropdowns, flipping boxes and more animated components to make the site more playful. 

I do not know if my design is good to everybody's eyes because this site is made with a lot of struggle from a novice, not your-average-learner guy and just used a Chromebook.

# Animation

Talking about animation, a trick told by my mentor to tilt the social media icon sideways. I thought it was cool. A simple change of color size is also applied to the money tree links.

# Wireframes

# Features

* index.html


This first page shows it all. Why the website is created, the websites it wants users to visit, why they should use MoneyTree instead of directly going to the actual recommendations.

* MoneyTrees


This is a link to the index section. I am still collating sites that I will add to this page but because there are just three I can share at the moment, I decided to just put those three infront.

* Signup page


This is the signup page where the users can subscribe to the forthnightly news letter.

# Encountered Problems

## Design

I was not sure how to start a design to a project. So I looked back at the projects and adopt the Love Running site as a basis of my design. 

## Responsive Design

As my learning and personal activities are conflicting there are times that it took long to  get back to my e-learning making me forget most of what the videos were telling me. As the videos are many, I used you tube and google search to show me how to create a responsive elements using bootstrap's cards, deck of cards, etc., and just picked what I seemed appropriate. 

## Messed up with GITHUB

I was making a duplicate html and css while I was editing the project at GITPOD. I usually add, commit and push them together to GITHUB with the other files. When I saw those duplicate files at GITHUB, I deleted them from there.

GITPOD no longer allowed me to push anyfile from the workspace. With many attemps and employed advises without success, I decided to create a new workspace using the codes from the previous one, that's why moneytree became moneybranch.

## The Future

In the future, I want to learn how to amend this mistake and this experience can serve as a precaution to newbie like me to be careful whilst in GITHUB.
