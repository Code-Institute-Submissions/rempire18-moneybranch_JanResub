* I thought about this project as there were times that I don't have any income.
* Because of my restrictions, I just find a way to hustle everyday for money.
* So here comes the internet for the rescue. It pointed me to sites where I can earn a hotmeal after using a mouse or tapping a mobile screen.
* As there are many websites out there that do this, some can be hard to deal with (meaning always screened out, takes too long to make a cash out), I decided to make a list of those sites I personally tried and tested.

# User Goals
* Users want to explore ways of monetizing their clicks and taps on their devices.
* Users want to help the internet community to improve user experiences by testing sites and getting paid for it.
* Users want to have something that can make them get by when money is hard to come by.
* note: this is not a get rich scheme or an alternative to employment.

# Developer Goals
* It aims to identify websites that are legitimate in this business.
* We will build functionalities and ratings review to sites we test.
* Will create search according to these ratings.

# Website Owner Goals
* We will personally test websites offering this kind of service on money you can earn versus the time you spend.
* We will advice you if you are just wasting your time or it is time to move on to another services.
* We will conduct testing on sites shared by our users.

# A User's Story

* There's a time that a sanction affected my work and I need to abandon my job. I need to  start somewhere in a new world that I am not familiar with. With no friends to turn to and family's very far away, I decided to look for something in the virtual world.

* At first, it is a challenge and like in the real world, there are plenty of sites that just waste your time and want to get your money. Luckily I do not have what they want and left me alone. 

* I came across website testing, mystery shopping and academic research, all online. Now I can afford a KFC meal. I know it is not much, but for me with my feet and hands tied to afford this is something.

# Design Choices

This site is geared to those people looking for a legitimate way to get something from their browsing experience. So links to legitimate, tested and real money making sites without cash outlay are in this site. 

So simple design is in mind. An introduction to what MoneyTree is all about, it's aim, what it can do to the user and simple links that transport the user to the legitimate sites.

A signup page for news letters that is set for at least every forthnight is also provided.

## Colors

I was thorn between the color of money and leaf as the main theme, but because they are both represent money, I used them both throughout the project. I used yellow, green and blue plus the neutral white and near-black to show the diversity of what money can do in the world.

## Typography

I used Oswald family, sans-serif font to make the design simpler and more money looking.

## Images

I used screenshots I made my own and the main image from pexels. The icons were grabbed from fonawesome.

## Design Elements

This is my first time to make a website from scratch. I do not know what works and I do not know what components to fit in. So I based most of the design from the project Love Running, like the top menu, footer, buttons and texts inputs.

I also used mainly google to point me on how to make boxes, cards, bootstraps etc. I am pointed usually to the direction of W3C to get shippets of the codes as the instructions to do this in the videos took me hours of sifting thorough the instructions I need. 

In the future, I would like to make everything with dropdowns, flipping boxes and more animated site. 

I do not know if my design is good to the everybody's eyes but it is just basically this site is made with a lot of struggle from a novice, not your-average-learner guy who just used a Chromebook.

# Animation

Talking about animation, a trick told by my mentor to tilt the social media icon sideways. I thought it was cool. A simple change of color size is also applied to the money tree links.

# Wireframes

# Features

* index.html


This first page shows it all. Why the website is created, the websites it wants users to visit, why they should use MoneyTree instead of directly going to the actual recommendations.

* MoneyTrees


This is a link to the index section. I am still collating sites that I will add to this page but because there are just three I can share at the moment, I decided to just put those three infront.

* Signup page


This is the signup page where the users can subscribe to the forthnightly news letter.
